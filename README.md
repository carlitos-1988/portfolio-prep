## About me 
creator of stuff and things

Software developer with a passion in IT and Aerospace manufacturing.

What exites me about tech is how developers are not only technically inclined but also artists in their own right. Technology has a way to simplify and connect life as we know it. My goal is to continue to contribute to this by implementing what I have learned in life to the applications I develop.
